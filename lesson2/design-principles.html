                    There are many factors when considering the alignment of items on a webpage. 
                    Wedevs' website uses a vast combination of these elements. The homepage has 
                    several examples of horizontal and vertical alignment. The page is 
                    well-centered, and pictures do not distract you too much from the text. Even 
                    as you scroll down the page, your eyes stay centered while looking at each 
                    item. This keeps the user from getting too distracted and keeps the user 
                    engaged and interested.

            <fieldset class="contrast">
                <h2>
                    Contrast
                </h2>
                <h3>
                    Panic
                </h3>
                <h4><a href="https://panic.com" target="_blank">panic.com</a></h4>
                <img id="panic" src="images/panic.jpeg" alt="Image of Panic's homepage">
                <p>
                    From the text to the colors to shapes, Panic's website is a perfect example 
                    of contrast. Everything on their page stands out on its own. There is no 
                    doubt that the contrast theme was intentional. The padding around each item 
                    allows for that item to contrast against the background. The sizes of the 
                    text and pictures give plenty of contrast to each individual element. The 
                    colors are bold, yet it is not overwhelming, thus allowing you to see each 
                    item clearly.

            <fieldset class="space">
                <h2>
                    White Space and Clean Design
                </h2>
                <h3>
                    Apple
                </h3>
                <h4><a href="https://apple.com" target="_blank">apple.com</a></h4>
                <img id="apple" src="images/apple.jpeg" alt="Image of Apple's homepage">
                <p>
                    Apple's website is a prime example of white space because of the simplicity 
                    of its website. There are not many things on the page, but how the white 
                    space draws your attention to the items they are trying to highlight is 
                    enticing. It allows for the items on the page to almost jump off of the page. 
                    This example of white space helps me to realize that starting with too much 
                    white space and slowly narrowing it down to what the page needs are the best 
                    approaches to building a website with white space in mind.
